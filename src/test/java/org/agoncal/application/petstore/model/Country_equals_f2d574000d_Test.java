/*
1. Scenario: Test when the object passed to the function is the same as the current object.
   - Description: The function should return true when the object passed is the same as the current object. This is because they both refer to the same memory location, hence they are identical.

2. Scenario: Test when the object passed to the function is null.
   - Description: The function should return false when the object passed is null. This is because a null object does not have a class, hence it cannot be equal to the current object.

3. Scenario: Test when the object passed to the function is of a different class.
   - Description: The function should return false when the object passed is of a different class. This is because objects of different classes cannot be equal.

4. Scenario: Test when the object passed to the function is of the same class but has a different isoCode.
   - Description: The function should return false when the object passed is of the same class but has a different isoCode. This is because the isoCode is used to determine equality.

5. Scenario: Test when the object passed to the function is of the same class and has the same isoCode.
   - Description: The function should return true when the object passed is of the same class and has the same isoCode. This is because the isoCode is used to determine equality.

6. Scenario: Test when the object passed to the function is of the same class, has the same isoCode, but the isoCode field in one of the objects is null.
   - Description: The function should handle this scenario without throwing a null pointer exception. The expected behavior depends on the business rules for handling null isoCodes.

7. Scenario: Test when the object passed to the function is a subclass of the current object.
   - Description: The function should return false when the object passed is a subclass of the current object. This is because a subclass is not the same as the superclass.

8. Scenario: Test when the object passed to the function is a superclass of the current object.
   - Description: The function should return false when the object passed is a superclass of the current object. This is because a superclass is not the same as the subclass.
