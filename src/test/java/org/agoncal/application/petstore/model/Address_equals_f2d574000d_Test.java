/*
1. Scenario: Test when the object is compared to itself. 
    - Given: The same object is used for comparison in the equals method.
    - Expected: The function should return true as an object is always equal to itself.
  
2. Scenario: Test when the object is compared to null.
    - Given: A null object is used for comparison in the equals method.
    - Expected: The function should return false as an object is not equal to null.
  
3. Scenario: Test when the object is compared to an object of a different class.
    - Given: An object of a different class is used for comparison in the equals method.
    - Expected: The function should return false as an object is not equal to an object of a different class.
  
4. Scenario: Test when the object is compared to an object of the same class but with different field values.
    - Given: An object of the same class but with different field values is used for comparison in the equals method.
    - Expected: The function should return false as the objects have different field values.
  
5. Scenario: Test when the object is compared to an object of the same class and with the same field values.
    - Given: An object of the same class and with the same field values is used for comparison in the equals method.
    - Expected: The function should return true as the objects have the same field values.

6. Scenario: Test when the object is compared to an object of the same class but with null field values.
    - Given: An object of the same class but with null field values is used for comparison in the equals method.
    - Expected: The function should return false as the objects have different field values.

7. Scenario: Test when the object has null field values and compared to an object of the same class with the same null field values.
    - Given: An object with null field values is used for comparison in the equals method with another object having null field values.
    - Expected: The function should return true as the objects have the same field values (null in this case). 

8. Scenario: Test when the object is compared to an object of the same class but with some of the fields being equal and others not.
    - Given: An object of the same class is used for comparison in the equals method with some of the fields being equal and others not.
    - Expected: The function should return false as not all fields are equal.
